        <h2>About The Ghost Project</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Ghost Project. My name is James Jethro P. Dizon and i created this Website with half of the content being horror while the other half is a satire take on the issues and memes of my home country the Philippines specifically to some certain people in order to masquerade my disappointment towards the following issues and at the same time make a fanmade document with a horror twist to those people or issues.</p>
        <p>My mission is to deliver horror enthusiast a website where they can experience shopping and also to probably make other people laugh with my satirical takes or memes.</p>
        <p>Explore the collections, learn about the legends behind the stories and laugh if you want as we tackle in an adventure between spooky and comedy.</p>
